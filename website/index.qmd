## Welcome

These are the materials for a one-day workshop on <b>Building Data Science Workflows in R Using Posit Tools</b> on September 16, 2025 at [posit::conf 2025](http://pos.it/conf)!

In this R-focused workshop, we will discuss ways to improve your data science workflows. During the course, we will review packages for data validation, alerting, modeling, and more. We‚Äôll use Posit‚Äôs open source and professional tools to string all the pieces together for an efficient workflow. We‚Äôll discuss environments, managing deployed content, working with databases, and interoperability across data products.
